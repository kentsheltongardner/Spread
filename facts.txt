Definitions

A cell has even parity if the sum of its x and y positions is even, otherwise it has odd parity

A collapsed number can spread into as many cells as any of its factors
    For example, 24 can spread into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 cells
    19, which is prime, can spread into 1 or 19 cells
    1 cannot spread

A 'spread' is an exact division of a number across contiguous cells
A 'gather' is the reverse of a spread in which a group of number all equal to each other are gathered


In a contiguous group of the same number
    The number of even and odd cells cannot differ by more than 1 for the group to merge

As long as it is able to move, an even number can move anywhere.
    If there is space, any puzzle beginning with only even numbers can be solved

Any odd number will favor odd or even cells when it spreads
    If it divides into even numbers, splitting them will double the 

Only odd numbers suffer from 


Changing between parity classes?

What happens with zero? Negative numbers? Infinity


Zero

If zero is included, it can be spread or gathered arbitrarily. The value is not stable


Infinity

Like zero, infinity can be spread or gathered arbitrarily. The value is not stable


Negative numbers

Negative numbers would operate with themselves just like positive numbers operate with themselves
    Under the current rules of the game there is no mechanism for combining them
    Perhaps negative and positive numbers could annihilate?
